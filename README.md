# BayesianOptimization
Bayesian Optimization with several acquisition functions

## Overview
Bayesian Optimization (BO) is used in the optimization of black box functions with high observation costs.
In BO, black box function is estimated by a Bayesian model and the next observation point is determined by the acquisition function.
The balance between exploitation and exploration depends on the acquisition function.
I use following acquisition functions.

### Probability of Improvement (PI)
Using the improvement probability for the current best function value.

### Expected Improvement (EI)
Using the expected improvement for the current best function value.

### Lower Confidence Bound (LCB)
Using lower confidence bound.
In LCB, we need to set the exploitation-exploration trade-off parameter β^{1/2}.
I use β^{1/2}=1,4.

In GP-UCB,  β^{1/2} is determined according to iterations and in the following paper, it is shown that regret bounds are sublinear.

### Max value Entropy Search (MES)
Using mutual information with the optimal value.
I sampled the optimal values using sampling from the Gumbel distribution.
A method of sampling the optimal value using randam feature map is also proposed in the following paper.
